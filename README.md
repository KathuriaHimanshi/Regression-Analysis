# Regression-Analysis
Install

This project requires Python and the following Python libraries installed:

NumPy

Pandas

matplotlib

scikit-learn

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a Jupyter Notebook

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the Anaconda distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included.

Defination

Regression models (both linear and non-linear) are used for predicting a real value, like salary for example. If yourindependent variable is time, then you are forecasting future values, otherwise your model is predicting present butunknown values. Regression technique vary from Linear Regression to SVR and RandomForests Regression.

Type of Regression                                Conditions

1.Univariate                                      Only one quantitative response variable

2.Multivariate                                    Two or more quantitative response variables

3.Simple                                          Only one explanatory variable

4.Multiple                                        Two or more explanatory variables

5.Linear                                          All parameters enter the equation linearly, possibly after transformation of the data

6.Nonlinear                                       The relationship between the response and some of the explanatory variables is nonlinear 
                                                or some of the parameters appear nonlinearly, but no transformation is possible to make 
                                                the parameters appear linearly
                                             
Analysis of variance                            All explanatory variables are qualitative variables

Analysis of Covariance                          Some explanatory variables are quantitative variables and others are qualitative variables

Logistic                                        The response variable is qualitative

In this Repo, We will be implementing Univariate Regression Analysis of the following type 
(Note: Some explanatory variables are quantitative variables and others are qualitative variables)

1.Simple Linear Regression

2.Multiple Linear Regression

3.Polynomial Regression

4.Support Vector for Regression (SVR)

5.Decision Tree Classification

6.Random Forest Classification

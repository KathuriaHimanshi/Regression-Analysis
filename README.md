# Regression 

Regression models (both linear and non-linear) are used for predicting a real value, like salary for example. If yourindependent variable is time, then you are forecasting future values, otherwise your model is predicting present butunknown values. Regression technique vary from Linear Regression to SVR and RandomForests Regression.

### Types of Regression
| Types of Regression   |      Conditions     |  
|----------|:-------------:|
| Univariate |  Only one quantitative response variable| 
| Multivariate |    Two or more quantitative response variables   |   
| Simple  | Only one explanatory variable |    
| Multiple | Two or more explanatory variables |  
| Linear  | All parameters enter the equation linearly, possibly after transformation of the data |  
| Non-linear  | The relationship between the response and some of the explanatory variables is nonlinear or some of the parameters appear nonlinearly, but no transformation is possible to make the parameters appear linearly |  
| Analysis of variance  | All explanatory variables are qualitative variables |  
| Analysis of Covariance  | Some explanatory variables are quantitative variables and others are qualitative variables |  
| Logistic  | The response variable is qualitative |

`In this Repo, We will be implementing Univariate Regression Analysis of the following type (Note: Some explanatory variables are quantitative variables and others are qualitative variables)`

#### Install

This project requires **Python** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included.
